# BHTextField

`BHTextField` is a textfield that i have been using for several project. I would like to contribute and share.It is easy to use and friendly to storyboard. There are many features like error message, field validation(email, passport identification(Thailand) and birthdate).

## Versioning

swift 4.0++

## Usage

To start using the component add it to your project using CocoaPods.
The UI component can be used via the `BHTextField` class. This control can be used very similar to `UITextField` - both from Interface Builder, or from code.
